# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Phase 1 Core Public & Authentication
> Created: 2025-09-04

## Overview

Implement the foundational Lexag HOA platform with public bulletin viewing, resident authentication, and mobile-first responsive design. This phase establishes the core user experience for residents and property owners while setting up authentication infrastructure for future board management features.

## User Stories

### Public Visitor Experience

As a community visitor, I want to browse public bulletins and view amenity information, so that I can stay informed about community updates without needing an account.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- User visits the Lexag homepage and sees "Lexington Commons HOA" banner
- Two welcome images display prominently (side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile)
- Public bulletins stream below images with infinite scroll functionality
- User can navigate to static amenities and contact pages via sticky navigation
- All content is mobile-optimized for phone usage

### Resident Registration & Authentication

As a property owner or tenant, I want to create an account and log in, so that I can access resident-specific bulletins and prepare for future profile management.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- User clicks sign up from navigation menu
- Completes registration with AWS Cognito integration
- Receives email verification and confirms account
- Logs in and gains access to resident/owner-specific bulletin content
- Navigation updates to show authenticated user options

### Authenticated Bulletin Viewing

As an authenticated resident, I want to see bulletins targeted to my audience group, so that I receive relevant community communications.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Logged-in user views homepage with expanded bulletin access
- Bulletins display based on audience tags (residents, owners, plus public)
- Content includes rich text formatting and subject tag filtering
- Infinite scroll loads additional bulletins as user browses
- Mobile-first design ensures optimal phone experience

## Out of Scope
