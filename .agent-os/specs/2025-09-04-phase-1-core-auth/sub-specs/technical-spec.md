This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-04-phase-1-core-auth/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18+** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** build tool with hot reload for development
- **TailwindCSS 4.0+** with mobile-first responsive design
- **React Router v6+** for client-side navigation
- **Apollo Client** for GraphQL state management and caching

### Authentication Implementation
- **AWS Cognito User Pools** with email verification
