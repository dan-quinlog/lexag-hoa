# Product Mission

## Pitch

Lexag is an HOA management platform that helps homeowner associations streamline community operations by providing centralized communication, property management, and resident services in one comprehensive hub.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **HOA Boards**: Board members who need to manage community operations, communicate with residents, and oversee property management
- **Property Owners**: Homeowners who need to manage their profile, pay dues, and stay informed about community updates
- **Tenants/Residents**: Renters who need access to community information and amenities

### User Personas

- **Role:** HOA Board President
- **Context:** Volunteers time to oversee community operations and needs full access to all management functions
- **Pain Points:** Scattered communication tools, manual payment tracking, difficulty coordinating with other board members
- **Goals:** Efficient community management, transparent communication, streamlined operations

**Property Owner** (30-70 years old)
- **Role:** Homeowner/Landlord
- **Context:** Owns property in the community and needs to stay compliant with HOA requirements

## The Problem

### Fragmented Communication Systems

HOA boards struggle with scattered communication across emails, physical notices, and phone calls, leading to missed announcements and poor resident engagement. Studies show 60% of HOA disputes stem from communication issues.

**Our Solution:** Centralized bulletin system with role-based messaging and infinite scroll updates.

### Manual Administrative Processes

Board members waste 10+ hours per month on manual tasks like payment tracking, resident queries, and property record management instead of focusing on community improvement.

**Our Solution:** Integrated CRM with automated workflows for payments, queries, and resident management.

### Limited Resident Self-Service

Property owners and tenants have no way to independently access their information, make payments, or submit requests, creating bottlenecks for board members.

**Our Solution:** Self-service resident portal with profile management, payment processing, and query submission.

## Differentiators

### Role-Based Access Control

Unlike generic property management tools, we provide granular permission systems tailored specifically for HOA governance with President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Media roles having appropriate access levels.

### Community-Focused Design

While other platforms focus on rental management, Lexag is built specifically for HOA communities with features like public amenity displays, resident bulletin boards, and community engagement tools.

### Integrated Financial Management

Unlike separate billing systems, we provide seamless dues collection with property-specific billing and integrated payment processing designed for HOA assessment workflows.
